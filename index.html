# Musings on Code Quality

# Elegant code can be high quality code

The devil is in the details!

.center[.img-max-width-40[![a very elegant robot](Atlas_frontview_2013.jpg)]]

???

It is very pretty.

You can tell that it is complex.

However, what's happening beneath the surface?

---

# Robust code is often high quality code

.center[.img-max-width-75[![a very robust jeep](willys-jeep-mb-2745709_960_720.png)]]

???

It works.

It is not very complicated.

You know that it is not going to let you down at a critical moment.

---

# What is high quality code?

High quality code is code, that...

* Does what it is supposed to do, and nothing else
* Is easy to understand and modify
* Is easy to test
* Does not waste resources unnecessarily

---

# Has this ever happened to you?

"I thought it would take 3 days to do this, but ... something came up."

"We have a milestone on Friday ... and everything stopped working this morning."

What's that? Surprises during development?

---

# Why high quality code is important

Surprises mess with the planning.

Surprises make you work weekends, or miss milestones.

Surprises are bad.

High quality code => fewer surprises.

# Code quality changes over time


---

# What happens if we pay attention to code quality?

Business as usual.

---

# What happens if we _do not_ pay attention to code quality?

Development goes slower and slower.

We introduce more bugs as we work on the code.

It becomes more and more difficult for us to test our own work.

When things have gone too far: "We should rewrite the entire program from scratch".

---

# This is referred to as "technical debt"

We did not pay off our debts; now the interest rate is killing us.

# Strategies for upholding high code quality

---

# Optimize your code for "finding errors early"

Design code so that...
1. people use/modify it correctly on their first attempt
2. or, mistakes result in compile time errors
3. or, mistakes result in runtime errors early
4. or, mistakes always result in runtime errors

---

# Name things precisely

When you name a variable / function / class,
find a name that makes the reader understand:
* what is its purpose?
* what is _NOT_ its purpose?

These two are equally important.

---
# Name things precisely

```c++
struct PlayerParams
{
	int score0, score1;
};
```

vs

```c++
struct PlayerParams
{
	int previousMatchScore, currentMatchScore;
};
```

---

# Name things precisely

```c++
vector<Enemy*> getEnemies(const Player& p, float distance);

void handleEnemies(const Player& p, const vector<Enemy*>& enemies);
```

vs

```c++
vector<Enemy*> getEnemiesWithinRange(const Player& p, float maxDistance);

void repelEnemiesFromPlayer(const Player& p, const vector<Enemy*>& enemies);
```

---

# Write self-commenting code

What's better than well-commented code?

Code that does not need comments.

---

# Use temp variables instead of comments

```c++
bool CanAttack(const Unit& source, const Unit& target)
{
	return !source.IsStunned() && !source.IsBlinded()
		&& Distance(source.Pos(), target.Pos()) <= source.AttackRange()
		&& source.Energy > 0;
}
```
vs
```c++
bool CanAttack(const Unit& source, const Unit& target)
{
	bool canPerformActions = (!source.IsStunned() && !source.IsBlinded());
	bool targetWithinRange = (Distance(source.Pos(), target.Pos()))
								<= source.AttackRange());
	bool hasEnergyLeft = (source.Energy > 0);

	return canPerformActions
		&& targetWithinRange
		&& hasEnergyLeft;
}
```

---

# Use helper methods instead of comments

```c++
bool CanAttack(const Unit& source, const Unit& target)
{
	return !source.IsStunned() && !source.IsBlinded()
		&& Distance(source.Pos(), target.Pos()) <= source.AttackRange()
		&& source.Energy > 0;
}
```
vs
```c++
bool CanAttack(const Unit& source, const Unit& target)
{
	return canPerformActions(source)
		&& targetWithinRange(source, target)
		&& hasEnergyLeft(source);
}
```

---

# Minimize scope for variables

```c++
void ProcessPlayers(Game* game)
{
    Player* player0 = game->getPlayer0();
    player0->ProcessPlayer();

    Player* player1 = game->getPlayer1();
    player0->ProcessPlayer();               // ooops! runtime error!
}
```

vs

```c++
void ProcessPlayers(Game* game)
{
  {
    Player* player0 = game->getPlayer0();
    player0->ProcessPlayer();
  }

  {
    Player* player1 = game->getPlayer1();
    player0->ProcessPlayer();             // oops! compile time error!
  }
}
```

---

# Use the type system to your advantage

```c++
  int textureId;
  
  int loadTexture(const char* path);
  void destroyTexture(int textureId);

  ...
  for (int i = 0; i < numTextures; i++)
    destroyTexture(i);                  // oops! runtime error!
```

vs

```c++
  struct TextureId
  {
    int id;
  }
  
  TextureId loadTexture(const char* path);
  void destroyTexture(TextureId textureId);

  ...
  for (int i = 0; i < numTextures; i++)
    destroyTexture(i);                  // oops! compile time error!
```

---

# Use asserts

```c++

void ProcessPlayer(Player* p)
{
  Assert_IsNotNull(p);        // Self-documenting + runtime check
  ...
}
```

---

# Minimize the total complexity of the code

There is no good scientific measure for "total complexity".

I like to explain the measure like this:

_"Number of minutes it takes to thoroughly explain the code to a colleague"_

How to measure: explain it to a colleague!

Or "rubber duck" it...

.center[.img-max-width-40[![Rubber ducking](rubber_ducking.jpg)]]

---

# Self-review your code

Play devil's advocate:

* ”What if this pointer is 0?”
* ”What if this loop will run just 0 or 1 times?”
* ”What if that memory allocation fails?”
* ”What if there is no player object yet?”

Try to figure out ways in which your code can fail, and then re-design it so that it is foolproof

---

# Write unit tests for your code

Write code that executes those self-review cases on your code.

This is valuable because:

- You can easily re-run your tests in the future.
- Everyone else on your team can re-run your tests too!

---

# Write unit tests for your data

Write code that does sanity checks on your data.
